# Tired of the laggy connections? 

Are you part of the **four billion** people who do not have access to high-speed internet connections? Do you wish there was a **low latency alternative** to Zoom and Microsoft Teams that does not require a high quality internet access?

## Introducing asciifi
A fast low latency P2P video-calling platform that everyone with internet access can use. 

Connecting people in all the corners of the world, we hope that asciifi is able to remove the barrier to staying connected even if the infrastructure may not be in place. 

Whether you live in Silicon Valley or a remote rural area, your voice should not be limited by internet speed. Asciifi provides an avenue for the voices not heard and the faces not seen to finally be projected around the world.

##  Why asciffi?
With over **51%** of the world's population lacking reliable high speed internet, most of the common video conferencing platforms demand too much data and are not suitable for the underprivileged users. 

In order to mitigate the needs for high speed internet and still provide access to video conferencing software,  we created asciifi. Asciifi enables people from less privileged backgrounds to finally connect with other people all around the world. 

While other competitors have a latency anywhere form 30ms to 40ms, Asciifi is more than **3x faster** with an average latency of **10 ms**. It removes the bottleneck of sending video by sending text instead.

Why send gigabytes of data when you can send **1000 times less data** and send megabytes of data? Asciifi has lower barrier to entry and makes sure that more people have access to reliable video conferencing.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
